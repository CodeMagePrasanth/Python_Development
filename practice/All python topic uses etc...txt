   - **Advantages**: Allows for selective skipping of loop iterations.
   - **Disadvantages**: May make code harder to understand if used excessively.
   - **Real-time Example**: Filtering out even numbers from a list.
   - **Example Program**:
     ```python
     numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     for num in numbers:
         if num % 2 == 0:
             continue
         print(num)
     ```

5. **pass Statement**:
   - **Definition**: The `pass` statement is a placeholder that does nothing.
   - **Uses**: Placeholder for future code or to avoid syntax errors.
   - **Advantages**: Helps in writing skeleton code or stubs.
   - **Disadvantages**: Can be misused to create unfinished code.
   - **Real-time Example**: Creating an empty function.
   - **Example Program**:
     ```python

      ```
"""

Certainly, let's explore Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including their definitions, uses, advantages, disadvantages, real-time examples, and one example program for each type:

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:

1. **Definition**:
   - **Definition**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that
    uses objects, which are instances of classes, to structure and organize code.

2. **Uses**:
   - Modeling real-world entities and their behavior.
   - Encapsulation of data and methods.
   - Enhancing code reusability and maintainability.

3. **Advantages**:
   - Modularity: Code is organized into reusable objects and classes.
   - Abstraction: Hides implementation details, focuses on high-level interactions.
   - Inheritance: Enables code reuse and hierarchy.
   - Polymorphism: Objects of different classes can be treated uniformly.

4. **Disadvantages**:
   - Complexity: Learning and implementing OOP concepts can be challenging for beginners.
   - Overhead: May introduce some performance overhead due to object creation and method calls.

5. **Real-time Example**: Creating a `Person` class to represent individuals.

   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age

       def greet(self):
           return f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old."
   ```

**Classes and Objects**:

1. **Class Definition**:
   - **Definition**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure (attributes) and behavior (methods) of objects.

2. **Uses**:
   - Defining the structure and behavior of objects.
   - Encapsulating data and functionality within a single unit.

3. **Advantages**:
   - Code organization: Groups related data and functions.
   - Reusability: Allows creating multiple objects with the same structure and behavior.

4. **Disadvantages**:
   - Overhead: Class creation can introduce overhead.
   - Complexity: Complex class hierarchies can be challenging to manage.

5. **Real-time Example**: Creating a `Car` class with attributes and methods.

   ```python
   class Car:
       def __init__(self, make, model):
           self.make = make
           self.model = model

       def start_engine(self):
           return f"{self.make} {self.model}'s engine started."

       def stop_engine(self):
           return f"{self.make} {self.model}'s engine stopped."
   ```

**Inheritance**:

1. **Inheritance Definition**:
   - **Definition**: Inheritance allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class).

2. **Uses**:
   - Reusing code and behavior from an existing class.
   - Building class hierarchies and specialization.

3. **Advantages**:
   - Code Reuse: Avoids redundant code by inheriting from a base class.
   - Hierarchy: Supports creating specialized subclasses.

4. **Disadvantages**:
   - Tight Coupling: Excessive inheritance can lead to tight coupling and reduced flexibility.

5. **Real-time Example**: Creating a `Student` class that inherits from a `Person` class.

   ```python
   class Student(Person):
       def __init__(self, name, age, student_id):
           super().__init__(name, age)
           self.student_id = student_id

          def study(self, subject):
           return f"{self.name} is studying {subject}."
   ```

**Polymorphism**:

1. **Polymorphism Definition**:
   - **Definition**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.

2. **Uses**:
   - Treating objects uniformly despite their specific class.
   - Achieving flexibility and extensibility.

3. **Advantages**:
   - Flexibility: Supports handling diverse objects through a common interface.
   - Extensibility: New classes can be added without affecting existing code.

4. **Disadvantages**:
   - Requires adherence to a common interface, which may not always be practical.

5. **Real-time Example**: Using polymorphism to create a list of different animals and make them all "speak."

   ```python
   class Animal:
       def speak(self):
           pass

   class Dog(Animal):
       def speak(self):
           return "Woof!"

   class Cat(Animal):
       def speak(self):
           return "Meow!"

   animals = [Dog(), Cat()]
   for animal in animals:
       print(animal.speak())
   ```
