with out importing any packages how predefined string in built function are working in python

In Python, there are some built-in functions and methods that are available without importing any packages or modules.
These functions and methods are included in the Python interpreter itself and are always available for use.

For example, the string in-built functions such as len(), str(), format(), upper(), lower(), replace(), split(), etc.
are always available for use in Python without any import statements.

These functions and methods are implemented in the C programming language, which is the underlying language of Python.
 They are compiled as part of the Python interpreter and are always available for use, regardless of whether any additional
  modules or packages have been imported.

Therefore, you can use these in-built functions and methods in your Python code without importing any packages.
