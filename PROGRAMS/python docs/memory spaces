In Python, memory locations refer to the addresses where objects are stored in memory. There are two primary types of memory locations you might encounter:

1. **Stack Memory (Call Stack):**
   - Stack memory is used for storing function call frames, local variables, and managing function calls.
   - It follows a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order.
   - Well-suited for managing function calls and local variables.

   Example:
   ```python
   def add(a, b):
       result = a + b  # 'result' is a local variable stored in stack memory
       return result

   x = 5
   y = 3
   sum_result = add(x, y)  # Function call frames are managed in stack memory
   ```

2. **Heap Memory:**
   - Heap memory is used for storing objects with a longer lifetime, such as objects created dynamically.
   - Objects in heap memory are accessed through references (variables storing memory addresses).
   - Python's memory manager handles heap memory automatically, including memory allocation and deallocation.

   Example:
   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name):
           self.name = name

   person1 = Person("Alice")  # 'person1' references an object in heap memory
   person2 = Person("Bob")    # 'person2' references another object in heap memory
   ```

It's important to note that Python abstracts much of the memory management from the programmer, making it unnecessary to manually allocate or deallocate memory. Python's memory manager, through techniques like reference counting and garbage collection, handles memory allocation and cleanup automatically. Developers typically work with high-level objects and variables, and the memory management is abstracted from them for ease of use and to prevent common memory-related errors.
